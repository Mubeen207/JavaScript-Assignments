# JavaScript Assignments Overview

This repository contains two JavaScript assignments, organized by section and task.  
Each folder contains properly structured code with tasks completed according to the assignment requirements.

## Assignments

1. **(ES6) JavaScript Core Concepts Assignment 1**
   - Focuses on fundamental ES6 concepts including:
     - Variables (`let`, `const`)
     - Template literals
     - Arrow functions
     - Array methods (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`)
     - Destructuring, Rest & Spread operators
   - All tasks are organized into sections and clearly labeled.

2. **(ES6) JavaScript Advanced Concepts Assignment 2**
   - Covers advanced topics such as:
     - Hoisting, Call Stack, and Closures
     - Custom array method simulation
     - Combining array methods for data processing
     - Spread and Rest operator usage
     - Nested function calls and asynchronous behavior
   - Tasks are completed with clear console logs to demonstrate execution flow.

## Structure

- Each folder contains sections and tasks in separate files or code blocks.
- Code is logged step-by-step to observe behavior.
- The folder names and file organization follow the assignment sections and task numbers for easy navigation.

## Notes

- All tasks have been tested and logged.
- Code is ready to run in a modern JavaScript environment (ES6+).
- This repository demonstrates understanding of both core and advanced JavaScript concepts.
